# Awesome-MLLM-Datasets
This project aims to collect and collate various datasets for multimodal large model training, including but not limited to pre-training data, instruction fine-tuning data, and In-Context learning data.

The goal of the project is to provide researchers with a comprehensive repository of resources to support their ability to more easily access high-quality datasets when developing and optimizing multimodal AI systems.
